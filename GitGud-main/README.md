**GitGud-A Guided Competitive Coding Platform**

**GitGud** is an innovative web application designed to assist users step-by-step while solving competitive programming problems sourced from popular platforms like **LeetCode, Codeforces, and CodeChef**.  
It uses a smart progression-based assistance model where users receive **basic code hints**, **algorithmic guidance**, and **full solutions** â€” depending on how long they struggle with a problem.  
Additionally, the platform intelligently **suggests the next problem** based on user performance and difficulty level.

# **What are we trying to solve?**

Competitive programming can often feel overwhelming for beginners. Immediate exposure to hard problems without guided learning discourages continuous practice.  
This platform offers a **structured and encouraging journey**, helping users gradually reach full solutions while learning and reflecting on their problem-solving process.  
By balancing **support** and **challenge**, it promotes **real skill growth** rather than spoon-feeding answers.
