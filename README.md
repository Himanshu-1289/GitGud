GitGud-A Guided Competitive Coding Platform

GitGud is an innovative web application designed to assist users step-by-step while solving competitive programming problems sourced from popular platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and CodeChef.
It uses a smart progression-based assistance model where users receive basic code hints, algorithmic guidance, and full solutions â€” depending on how long they struggle with a problem.
Additionally, the platform intelligently suggests the next problem based on user performance and difficulty level.
